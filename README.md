# Constant Sniping
Constant Sniping is a mod where every 30 seconds, a crosshair spawns on the player and follows the player around. 
If the player wasn't able to get out of the crosshair in 8 seconds, then they will get insta kill.

The sniper will get faster if a boss is alive.
The sniper will also get faster throughout the progression.

you can configure the settings of the mod.
